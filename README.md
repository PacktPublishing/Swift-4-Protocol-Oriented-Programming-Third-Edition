This is the code repository for [Swift 4 Protocol-Oriented Programming - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/swift-protocol-oriented-programming-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788470032), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will help you understand the differences between object-oriented programming and protocol-oriented programming. It will demonstrate how to work with protocol-oriented programming using real-world use cases. You will gain a solid knowledge of the various types that can be used in Swift and the differences between value and reference types. You will be taught how protocol-oriented programming techniques can be used to develop very flexible and easy-to-maintain code.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
protocol ZombieObserver {  
  func turnLeft() 
  func turnRight()  
  func seesUs() 
} 
```

To follow along with the examples in this book, the reader will need to have an Apple computer with OS X 10.13 or higher installed. They will also need to install XCode version 9.0 or higher with Swift version 4 or higher. The reader should possess at least basic knowledge of the Swift programming language.
